The Faithkeepers arise as spiritual guardians of the city, embodying the belief that only faith, devotion, and shared belief can preserve humanity against the frozen wasteland.
They are the priests, caretakers, and inquisitors of belief, guiding the people not through written law, but through divine purpose.
They are often seen wearing robes and symbols of faith, marking them as servants of something greater than the individual.

They move among the population offering prayer, comfort, and direction, striving to keep despair from consuming the fragile community.
To the starving, the sick, and the hopeless, they appear as shepherds who promise meaning and hope beyond suffering.
Yet to skeptics and dissenters, they are feared as fanatics who demand obedience to doctrine above reason.

Their philosophy is unwavering: without faith, there is no survival.
They see doubt as corruption, and heresy as a contagion more dangerous than the frost itself.
This conviction drives them to impose strict rituals, public penance, and severe punishment for blasphemy or defiance, measures many citizens consider extreme but spiritually necessary.
For the Faithkeepers, justice is not about law or fairness, but about salvation through belief, unity, and unquestioned devotion.
