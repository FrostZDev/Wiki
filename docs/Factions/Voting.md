The colony holds elections in certain intervals.
During those voting cycles the governing faction is determined.
Every inhabitant of the colony is capable to vote for either [lawkeepers](Lawkeepers.md) or [faithkeepers](Faithkeepers.md) during a voting cycle.

In order to cast a vote the voting menu (assign hotkey in the controls menu) must be used.
Each player who is online at the time of voting may cast one vote for either faction.
Chose wisely - the vote can not be changed after it has been cast!
During each voting cycle a different faction my be chosen.

After the voting cycle ended the controling power over the colony is transfered to the new governing faction.
The members of the new coverning faction is granted the power to perform all the special actions like [building](../Building/Basics.md), [upgrades](../Building/Upgrades.md) and more.
