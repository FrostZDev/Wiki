The idea was to recreate Frostpunk 1 as a first-person RP survival experience where you start as a survivor near the crater, with just the generator and a few basic supply piles—just like the beginning of a classic Frostpunk game.

You’ll gather resources and bring them to the resource depot, making sure you always have enough coal to keep the generator running. From there, the mayor begins constructing the first essential buildings: tents for housing, a sawmill to turn logs into planks, a medical tent to craft supplies and treat frostbite, a hothouse to grow crops, and more.

Every building serves a purpose, and as you contribute to the community, you’ll earn skill points to unlock new abilities and crafting recipes—similar to Frostpunk’s tech tree, but on a personal level.
You won’t be able to do everything yourself. Everyone in the community will need to find their own role. One player might become the tailor, crafting insulated coats; another the cook; someone else might train to become the doctor. No one can be a jack of all trades—and that’s by design.

Once you’ve secured the basics to survive the first storm, you’ll start building more advanced structures, and eventually set out on expeditions—to hunt, scavenge, or search for rare resources and ingredients.

And of course, anything is possible. Maybe you don’t like the mayor’s rules. Maybe the community agrees. Maybe you exile him—and become the new mayor yourself.
