Some buildings can be upgraded by the [governing](../Factions/Voting.md) faction.

Buildings which can be upgraded will grant a F-action at the building.
Upgrades do not come for free but cost resources the same way as [building](Basics.md).

[Resources](../Resources/Resources.md) are automatically consumed from the depot if a upgrade is being installed.

Some upgrades require other upgrades to be installed first.
