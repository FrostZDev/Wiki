The heat level indicates the positive or negative temperature delta based on the overall temperature.  
It is indicated by a status badge indicator (![IconSmall](../assets/images/Wood.png)) on the player status hud the same way as vanilla status indicators are shown.

The added or substracted heat level is shown as an additional bage indicator value on the status badge.

Each positive level provides enough to heat to counter -10Â°C of environmental temperatue.  
The heatlevel directly impacts the [heat buffer stat](HeatBuffer.md)

Bonus Tipp: The environmental temperature and how it will change over time can be observed using the [beacon](../Buildings/beacon.md)
