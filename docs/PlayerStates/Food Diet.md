The food diet is a (to the player) hidden stat.
It is influenced by the food a player consumes.
"Bad" food will decrease the state and "good" food will increase it. (Food can also be neutral having no impact on the stat).

If the stat gets to low the player will get sick. Make sure to balance the food consumes by the player.
