From there, the mayor begins constructing the first essential buildings: tents for housing, a sawmill to turn logs into planks, a medical post to craft supplies and treat frostbite, a hothouse to grow crops, and more.</p> <p>Every building serves a purpose, and as you contribute to the community, you\u2019ll earn skill points to unlock new abilities and crafting recipes\u2014similar to Frostpunk\u2019s tech tree, but on a personal level. You won\u2019t be able to do everything yourself. Everyone in the community will need to find their own role. One player might become the tailor, crafting insulated coats; another the cook; someone else might train to become the doctor. No one can be a jack of all trades\u2014and that\u2019s by design.</p> <p>Once you\u2019ve secured the basics to survive the first storm, you\u2019ll start building more advanced structures, and eventually set out on expeditions\u2014to hunt, scavenge, or search for rare resources and ingredients.</p> <p>And of course, anything is possible.
